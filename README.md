> [!NOTE]
> SchoolRate is currently in development and not yet ready for production use. You are welcome to test the [latest alpha/dev build](https://github.com/SchoolRate/SchoolRate/releases/latest) at your own risk. We welcome feedback [here](https://github.com/SchoolRate/SchoolRate/issues).

## Motivation

The idea of SchoolRate came to us after we all had, at one point or another in our curriculum, issues with our teachers, or thought that we could improve the way they educate us. Even if we can talk to our teachers to adress these issues (and we already did), we believe that we aren't the only ones in France who suffer from pedagogical issues, and this is why we've had the idea of creating SchoolRate. We aren't perfect either, and are on track to become the ones who "rate those who rate". But that doesn't mean you can't rate us, and we are looking for feedback during the development of the application.

## Mission

SchoolRate will strive to deliver a great application, with rich functionality, while not diverting from the primary goal of making education better.
